Typescript :- Typescript is a progaming language developed by microsoft that is a superset of javascript it adds static typing and other features to javascript makeing it more robust and easier to manage especially for for large-scale application. 


Datatype:-

1. Primitive Datatype :- number ,  string ,  boolean 
2.Reference type Datatype :- arrays , Enum , tuples , any , unknown , void , null , undefined , never



Enumeration (or enum) is a concept used in programming to define a set of named constants. It is a way to represent a collection of related values in a more readable and maintainable manner. Instead of using arbitrary numbers or strings in your code, you use meaningful names to represent those values, which improves clarity and reduces errors.

In general terms, an enumeration is a type that consists of a set of named values called elements or members. These values can be either numbers, strings, or other constants, depending on the programming language.

differnce between any or unknown ? :- 

When to Use:

Use any when:

 #You need flexibility and don’t care about type checking (e.g., when dealing with external data that has an unknown or dynamic structure).
 #You are temporarily migrating or integrating JavaScript code into TypeScript.


Use unknown when:

#You need to handle potentially different types but want to ensure you validate the type before performing any operations.
#You want to take advantage of TypeScript’s type safety features, even when dealing with dynamic values.
#In most cases, unknown is preferred over any because it enforces type safety while still allowing flexibility.
